# AI Task Router — Multi-Platform Division of Labor

Status: Living reference document, update when a routing assignment proves wrong
Platforms: Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Kimi, DeepSeek

---

## Routing Decision Tree (run this first, every time)

1. Does it touch auth, payments, API keys, or RLS policies? → **Claude only.** Skip the rest of this tree.
2. Is it market/trend research or niche validation? → **Gemini**
3. Is it a first-draft technical spec, architecture blueprint, or SQL schema? → **DeepSeek**
4. Is it a no-code click-path (Bubble/Glide/FlutterFlow) or marketing/landing copy? → **ChatGPT**
5. Is it real-time social data, X/Twitter trends, or social hooks? → **Grok**
6. Is it a whole-repo audit, long-document synthesis, or session handoff? → **Kimi**
7. Anything else, or any conflict between two AI outputs → **Claude** (final arbiter)

## Assignment Table

| Task Type | Primary AI | Mechanism (why this AI) | Backup |
|---|---|---|---|
| Market & trend research | Gemini | Largest context window for synthesizing many sources into structured findings | DeepSeek |
| Technical blueprint / first-draft architecture | DeepSeek | Strong exhaustive technical reasoning at lowest cost (proven on PropBot blueprint) | Kimi |
| SQL schema / database first draft | DeepSeek | Proven pattern (PropBot schema), Claude audits before any table goes live | Claude (audit only) |
| No-code UI walkthroughs (Bubble, Glide, FlutterFlow) | ChatGPT | Deepest exposure to no-code platform documentation patterns | Gemini |
| Marketing/landing page copy, pricing pages | ChatGPT | Consistent structured persuasive copy | Grok (for raw/edgy variants) |
| Real-time social trend scanning, X hooks | Grok | Only platform with live X data access | — |
| Whole-repo audits, long handoff capsules | Kimi | Largest context window, persistent memory_space across a thread | Claude (final pass) |
| Security-sensitive code: auth, payments, RLS, API keys | Claude | Final say only, never delegated regardless of who drafted the surrounding code | — |
| Architecture decisions, conflict resolution between AI outputs | Claude | Cross-checker role: reconciles multiple AI outputs into one shippable artifact | — |
| Image/screenshot analysis, multimodal UI QA | Gemini | Strongest multimodal reasoning of the free-tier set | ChatGPT |

## Handoff Capsule (paste this between AIs so context survives the jump)

AI HANDOFF — [Project Name]
From: [AI name]
To: [AI name]
Task: [one sentence]
Constraints: Trinidad & Tobago, $0 budget, free-tier tools only, mobile-only editing
Input: [paste the source AI's output below this line]
Expected output: [exact format needed — code block / table / step list]

## Conflict Resolution Rule

If two AI outputs disagree (naming mismatch, conflicting schema, contradictory advice): paste both to Claude with the flag `//AUDIT CONFLICT`. Claude reconciles and ships the final version. Claude's call is final on anything touching security or architecture, no exceptions.

## Worked Example — ForecastOS 2026-06-20 Session

Gemini/Kimi produced the build analysis and refactoring handoff doc.
Claude implemented all prescribed fixes (PWA, email gate, Freedom Calculator)
then found and fixed two additional bugs (forecast horizon, CoinGecko reliability)
that the handoff doc didn't catch — surfaced only through direct live testing.

Lesson: handoff docs from research-oriented AIs (Gemini, Kimi) are necessary
but not sufficient. Always live-test after applying prescribed fixes before
moving to the next planned feature. The bugs that actually break usability
are often invisible until a human clicks through the real flow.

## Update Log

- 2026-06-20: Initial version, created to formalize the existing DeepSeek-blueprint / ChatGPT-build / Claude-audit pattern already proven on PropBot.
